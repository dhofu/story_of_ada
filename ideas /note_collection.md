## structure ideas 

# Introduction 
Introduction is being written together = collaborative writing 
-> we all take the same intro for our term papers 

# Main part 
-> have a small introduction to your section instead of putting it into the main introduction = small abstract about what you are about to write

1 IB: How the story of Ada Lovelace is used in the educational sector? -> every part of education
2 EH: Different perception between Ada and women nowadays -> Movie analysis & Gender perception
3 JS: Relevance of Ada and her perception in modern time -last 20 years- -> General percepton and media connection -change- importance in stem?
3 CJ: Perception of Ada in victorian time -> her immediate circle and the wider world of victorian science

sections can be interchanged and changed topic-wise this is more of a sketch 
# Conclusion
