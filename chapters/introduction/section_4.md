# Title of Section 4 of Introduction
```
This section of the introduction deals with justification and relevance.
This is where you integrate the initial comparison of viewpoints based on the reading of two articles (see VC course).
This section explains how and why we are dealing with Ada Lovelace, and why we have to do this now (urgency)?
