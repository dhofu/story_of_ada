# Title of Section 1 of Introduction
```
This section of the introduction contains 'a hook', a point of entry, for diving into the story of Ada Lovelace.
Here are some notes made during class:
Perhaps include General historical background here. Relate to Frankenstein, Bridgerton, etc. 
```

This is where you start writing the actual hook that introduces the reader to the story.<br>
Ada Lovelace and Bridgerton have a lot in common.<br>
